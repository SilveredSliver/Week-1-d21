    <p>I'm first generation born in America both my parent came to America from Mexico illegally with nothing but now both are USA citizens. I use my parent sacrifice as my motivation to succeed in life. I'm also the first member of my family to join the military, I served 8 years United States Air Force as Active duty. Thanks to my time in the military I got to travel to several country and experience all different culture around the world. After I left the military I became a CNC machinist where I learned to operate and program for CNC machines. Machining was not for me but I like to write the programs so I decide to attend Code Fellows to learn to code.</p>
